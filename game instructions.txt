[game feedback on clicking:-]

the game has no clicking sound/animation when pressing end turn , playing , attacking with a minion , 
 and when using hero power or casting spell , and it might get a little slower as the game progress and
  field or hand are getting full so just note that you may press end turn
 on late game and it will take just a second or so more than it did when starting the game to actually end turn but it won't freeze or anything just so you consider it .
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Hero Power :]
 
to use hero power just click on the circular image on the right of the hero image and if it doesn't 
require a target to be selected manually it will automatically get used , else if it needs a target ,,
 then a white box will appear around it indicating you selected the power to be used and then 
 you click on any minion or a hero image one click to be executed on according of course 
 to what this hero power can do  just like spell casting .
also it can be unselected if you click on it again case you changed you mind.

and its corresponding rarity so you can understand what each card rarity is and it explains
 an icon as "ZZZ" which means a minion is sleeping 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**** Resolution is fixed! **** :] 

the game was made to run on fixed resolution and scaling as it is preferred to be run on a 1920x1080 screen
 with scaling of 125% (from windows display settings) for optimum results ,, down to 100% scaling which 
 would make it look small 
any scaling larger than 125% may make it distorted or move some labels out of place so please consider this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[the card viewer and game components attributes:]

there is a card viewer label at the center left of game screen which shows any accessible game component 
that you can play if you hover above said component such as cards , field cards , hero image , hero power . 
and it also serves as a magnifying glass so if any detail of any card in hand for example is not clear enough 
can be read through it , also when hovering over a minion on the field it can show its card before playing 

NOTE : the card viewer doesn't reflect any change that happened on a card so it only shows the original card image
 so if a card got its mana changed it will be shown on hand cards only , and if a minion got any change in 
 its health/attack etc it will be shown on minion on field only not on his "magnified image" on the card viewer
